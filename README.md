# BubbleSort-and-MergeSort
Algorithm Visualizers using Python which show BubbleSort and MergeSort

Main idea of the project
------------------------
This project consists of 2 sorts: Merge Sort and Bubble Sort - both written in Python.
Merge Sort:
------------------------
The Merge Sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It splits up an array into 2 halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two halves together once again once both halves are sorted.
Bubble Sort:
------------------------
The Bubble Sort is the simplest sorting algorithm that works by repreatedly swapping adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
